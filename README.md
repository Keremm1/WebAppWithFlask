# WebAppWithFlask

My skills on the project:

-I worked on a web application with flask framework and wanted to share the resulting site.
-In this project, I was able to send requests to the website and return a response with the help of flask.
-I included python decorators, used the wrap decorator and effectively added to the functions.
-I created WTForms(StringField,PasswordField,TextAreaField,validators) for my web site.
-I used jinja templates on flask, applied to my website and rendered.
-I am able to pull data via form on website and save it to mysql data server.
-I have configured mysql database and flask app.
-I have performed sql queries. I performed deletion, update, insertion, table creation operations on all data registered to mysql.
-I exploded instant flash messages on the site with flash from Flask module.
-I encrypted the password with sha256 and saved it on the database.
-I did a lot of processing on html and css, bootstrap for design.
-I ran python codes thanks to flask on html.(these file is type of django html).In this way, I applied for loops if, elif, else condition blocks on html files (templates).

Operations that can be done on the website I created:
There are home page, about page, login and sign up pages in the website.
You can create a registration and open an account. This account will be saved in the mysql database with a special id on the backend. After that, you can log in to your registered account in the database. And in this way, you gain the authority to create articles or take action on your existing articles. All the articles you add can be easily updated or deleted via the control panel. However, you cannot interfere with other people's articles. Articles added by all users or by you can be viewed on the articles page. There are also pages where you can go to the dynamic url of each article and access the id, author, content and creation date. Do not forget to look at our about us page.
