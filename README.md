# WebAppWithFlask
I worked on a web application with flask framework and wanted to share the resulting site.
In this project, I was able to send requests to the website and return a response with the help of flask.
I included python decorators, used the wrap decorator and effectively added to the functions.
I created WTForms for my web site.
